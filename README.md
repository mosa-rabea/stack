# Stacks and Queues
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue




## Create a Stack class : 

* Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated:

we need to create this methods:

* push:adds a new node.
* pop: returns value node from the top of the stack .
* peek : returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
* is empty : returns boolean indicating whether the stack is empty.

## Create a Queue class :

* Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.

* we need to create this methods:
* enqueue.
* dequeue.
* peek .
* is empty.





## Approach & Efficiency

1. push and enqueue :

  * Time O(1)
  * Space O(1)
2. pop and dequeue :
  * Time O(1)
  * Space O(1)
  3. is empty :
  * Time O(1)
  * Space O(1)
4. peek :
  * Time O(1)
  * Space O(1)

  
## API :

1. Create a front property in the Queue class.
2. The following methods should be included in the class:
3. enqueue: adds the item to the rear of the queue as a new node.
4. dequeue:Returns the value from the queue's first node. Removes the node from the queue's front.

5. Create a top attribute for the Stack class.
6. The following methods should be included in the class:
7. push:pushes that value to the top of the stack as a new node.
8. pop:Returns the value of the top-of-the-stack node,
9. peek: removes the node from the stack's top: Returns: The node at the top of the stack's value is empty: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the stack is empty or not.
